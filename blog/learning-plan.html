        <p class="main-para">
          I have kept myself free for the Dev Academy journey. In the foundation period, I generally walked outdoors over the weekend. During the Bootcamp period, which I understand is an intense stage, I will have a run around the community (say 3 pm to 4 pm) when the weather allows.
