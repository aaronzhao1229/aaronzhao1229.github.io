            I worked as an acoustic engineer for five years. In 2021, I could not get happiness from work anymore, so I was considering if I would change my career. My top 3 core values are achievement, self-improvement and adventurousness. I thought through my work and tried to figure out if the work could match my core values. Firstly, I could not feel a sense of achievement, as I was doing relatively repetitive work. Secondly, I did not have significant self-improvement, although I could still learn something from every project. Thirdly, I got bored with the same life, which last for five years and needed something adventurous in my life. <br>
            Therefore, I decided to resign and planned to walk Te Araroa (The Long Pathway) south island part. At the same time, I figured out I would get into the IT field, which I am interested in.  <br>
            From the end of 2021, I walked the Te Araroa south island part and finished it at the beginning of March 2022, which is the biggest adventure I have done. At this stage, I am learning Web development with Dev Academy and trying to get into the IT field for work.

          <strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong>

        <p class="main-para">
          I am from China. The Chinese culture includes hard work and constant improvement. Children are encouraged to study hard and improve constantly. Therefore, the culture significantly affects my core values of achievement and self-improvement.

          Analytical: When I face learning obstacles, the problems will be well-analysed, which will help me figure out solutions.  <br>
          Fast learning: This will speed up the learning process, and I will have more time to deal with the obstacles. <br>
          Research: Research online may be a big part of problem-solving, which will help me figure out solutions.

        <p class="main-para">
          <strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used then, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</strong>

          When I was in China, I organised a dance group of ten people. We prepared a dance for the company celebration at the end of the year. We did not have much time to prepare. When we practised, we planned to spend more time and practice effectively when everyone showed up in one session. However, a girl in the group resisted more exercise in that session. As it was urgent to practice the dance, I did not use any strategy and just reduced the number of people in the group; the girl was no longer a part of the group. We performed well in the celebration, but the girl was grumpy at me and told my leader what had happened.  <br>
          Through reflections, I would now try to talk to her peacefully, figure out why there was resistance and what she needed, and let her know my feelings and what we need to in my mind. This way, we might figure out a solution and make both of us happy.
