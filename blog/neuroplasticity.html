         <p class="main-para">
          Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity will make people understand why 'practice makes permanent'. Therefore, if people want to improve their skills, they can keep practising. This also gives directions and motivations to people who need to recover from stroke, injury and mental health problems.

          <strong>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="main-para">
          A growth mindset means that you thrive on challenges, and don’t consider failure as a way to describe yourself but as a springboard for growth and developing your abilities. Your intelligence and talents are all susceptible to growth.
          <br>
          It is relevant because it can help us overcome obstacles we may face when learning something new. Growth mindsets understand the importance of persistence and determination.
          <br>
          By changing the way we think, we can change the way we learn. Knowing that our talents and intelligence can be developed allows us to explore, experience, and achieve more in life.

         <strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="main-para">
          I used to consider a failure really frustrating and always avoid it. If it came, I was really upset. However, in this exploration, it makes me think I should consider failure as a step toward growth. My goal is to grow and failure is a step to growth. Then I should not be upset by the failure.

        <p class="main-para">
          I can imagine there will be a lot of bugs in the codes I write. Sometimes it could be really frustrating, but I will try my best to consider them in a growth mindset way and as a step to the growth of my coding skills.

          These understandings will make more practices involved in my learning strategy. 
          Also, when I face obstacles, I will deal with them more positively, rather than just avoiding them.
