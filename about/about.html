            I worked as an Acoustic Engineer for 5 years after completing my studies for a Master of Engineering Studies at The University of Auckland, and am looking for the chance for my career change to the IT field.

            After working as an Acoustic Engineer for 5 years, I was aware that acoustic engineering was not what I was interested in and seeking a career change. After talking to a career consultant, programming/coding is on the top of the career list which I want to get into.

            <br>
            Whilst my studies are not specific to software development, they involved programming with coding languages including C++ and Matlab. When I coded during my studies at the university, I often lost track of time and realised I was passionate about coding, although this is a field that I was not familiar with.

            <br>
            Currently, I am studying a web development course at Enspiral Dev Academy (NZ’s premiere full immersion web development school). Associated languages include JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

            Apart from technology, I also love outdoor activities, such as tramping, snowboarding, surfing, tennis, mountaineering and the like. An achievement which I am proud of is the completion of Te Araroa south island part (Picton to Bluff) with an extension to Stewart Island. It took me 65 days to complete. There are some If you ask me about it, I will say "it is a fantastic journey and worth all the efforts. If you want to walk it, don’t hesitate and go ahead. Never too late.”
